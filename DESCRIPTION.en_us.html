    The objectives behind the Zain range of typefaces was to create a unique modern range (7 weights: Extralight, Light,
    Regular, Italic, Bold, ExtraBold and Black ) that support Arabic and Latin languages as well as Urdu, Farsi,
    Kurdish, Indonesian and Tagalog. It's suitable for headlines, sub-headings and body text, respecting Arabic
    calligraphy and cultural rules with maximum legibility. A key design objective has been the harmony between the
    Latin and the Arabic and its suitability for all communications needs, whether in print or on the web.
